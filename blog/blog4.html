    <h1>Bizarre <span>Folklores</span></h1>

    <p>The ideas and beliefs which are passed down from one generation to another is tradition. Exploring diverse cultures and traditions has always been exciting and enthralling. While several ancient traditions are relishable and charming practices, a few others appear to be downright dim-witted. Let’s review some of the primitive customs which pan out to be peculiar.
</p>

<p>Aren’t the euphonious giggles that escape a dainty infant when she is tenderly tossed in the air, and the gleam in her eye when her father protectively captures her back in his arms such a treat to witness? Well, an obnoxious modification of this wholesome action is identified as the ‘Toddler tossing tradition’ that the residents in some underdeveloped parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and even Karnataka follow.
</p>

<p>In this dangerous custom, toddlers are thrown from a 50 feet high temple and caught by a blanket from the ground that is spread out by devotees. Ironically, this dicey activity is said to render the children a long life. Hands down, insanity out-towered the height of the temple. Couldn’t we dedicate this custom, minus the catching the thrown with a blanket part for vile criminals instead of children? However, acknowledging the jeopardy this wild tradition could cause the kids, it was banned by Child rights in 2011.</p>

<p>
Haplessly, in life, we are frequently forced to renew our acquaintances with unpleasant circumstances. Bereavement is one such circumstance that smacks us with bleakness and throws us into the dark chambers of depression. The only thing in our power to overcome its blow is to permit time to heal our wounds and implore the almighty to help our lost loved one attain peace.
</p>
<p>In different cultures, the corpses are disposed of using distinct methodologies to help the souls attain peace. Some ethnic groups in Indonesia preserve the body of their loved ones in their houses only. Even though the imagination of living in the same household as the lifeless appears dreadful and ghastly(more like dead-ful and ghostly?), that community people insist that this assists them to stay connected with the dead and renders the souls the serenity they seek. Creepy, eh?  </p>

<p>Can you bear to recollect those uncomfortable moments during a car trip when you’re desperate to take a leak but just then your route appears devoid of petrol bulks and restaurants, and the journey looks to prolong indefinitely? Okay, it’s about time I present to you the absurd tradition of the Bathroom Ban followed in Indonesia. </p>

<p>The newly married couples of the Tidong community in Indonesia are forbidden from using the comfort room for three days after their wedding in the belief that it will endow them with a happily ever after. Yeah, that implies that the couple is prevented from urinating, defecating, and cleansing themselves for three days and is closely monitored by their relatives. The relatives ensure to sate their hunger and quench their thirst with appropriate consumables to support them pull this off. If only dodging the calls of nature are as effortless as dodging phone calls.</p>

<p>They say, “Never let your emotions rely on others’ actions'' but it's a cheesy source of amusement when her teenage loverboy says, “Babe wish me good night so that I can drift into a satisfying slumber” It’s a pure form of affection when the radiant grin of her better half gifts her with genuine happiness but it’s an indubitable form of insanity to hope that her husband has to endure physical agony, to relieve her of her anguish. Welcome to the ‘Carrying the conceived’ tradition in China.</p>

<p> 
In this strange tradition, the father-to-be is anticipated to cautiously pick up his pregnant wife and walk over a swath of evenly spread burning coal when entering their house. This inane performance is said to avail the conceived have a successful and seamless delivery. If the husband’s attempt is futile, then the child is termed to be “Cursed”. Oh please, open your eyes China. It is the tradition that’s cursed.
</p>

<p>Moving on, what do you think is the ideal age to get married? 24? 27? Ahoy, my singletons. Fantasize residing in Denmark, being unmarried, and desiring to have an ordinary birthday celebration when your age clock ticks 25. Heads up, this is going to be worse than Valentines’ day. Consider yourself unfortunate only if you don’t hit the hay that night without your friends and family ambushing you and covering you with cinnamon.</p>

<p>The cradle of this custom dates back to the early 1500s when all that the spice salesmen did was travel around the globe and never get to romantically involve themselves with eligible damsels. The streets of Denmark are often covered in cinnamon. Most importantly, this tradition isn’t to deride a vicenarian of his/her bachelorhood/spinsterhood but to pull a prank on their chaps. Try to get married before you turn 30 though because then cinnamon is replaced with pepper. 30 and single in Denmark? well that’d be life throwing lemons at you and you making a pepper lemonade out of it. Cheers!</p>

<p>Ornithophiles, assemble for the next one! Do you all regularly pause to bless your sight with the glory of the cute birds levitating around and take pleasure in watching them devour the bread crumbs you’ve tossed for them? Our fellow Britishers seemed to have taken their ineffable affection for the birds a trifle over the top. In England, overlooking the existence of a solo magpie is believed to bring misfortune.</p>

<p>So, while strolling across the streets of London, if you ever encounter a British bloke cheerfully engaging a magpie in a chinwag, it’s not because he has gone bonkers. It is just him asking his bad luck to bugger off. However, be considerate enough to warn your British acquaintances to restrain their socializing skills in the Indian streets.</p>

<p>Likely, the significance of a lot of the current cultures will eventually wane with further modernization of civilization. As much as it is indispensable to preserve our traditions and pass them on to the next generation as our ancestors did, it is equally important to analyze the absurdity in some customs and attempt to abolish the painful traditions solely for the welfare of humankind only. </p>
